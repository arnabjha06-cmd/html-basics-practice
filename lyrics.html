            Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends, but I'm me
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
All the things that you say, yeah
Is it life, or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day (take on me)
Take on me (take me on)
Take on me
I'll be gone (take on me, take on me)
In a day (take me on, take on me)
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
Take on me
